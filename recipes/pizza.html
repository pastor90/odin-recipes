        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Margherita pizza is a classic pizza that originated in Naples, Italy. It is made with a simple tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil, and is traditionally baked in a wood-fired oven. The ingredients are arranged in layers on top of a thin, crispy crust, and the pizza is baked until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
        </p>

            Margherita pizza is named after Queen Margherita of Savoy, who was said to have been served a pizza with the same ingredients by Raffaele Esposito, the owner of a pizzeria in Naples, in 1889. The red, white, and green colors of the ingredients were meant to mimic the Italian flag, and the pizza quickly became popular as a symbol of national pride. Today, margherita pizza is enjoyed all over the world and is considered one of the most classic and beloved types of pizza.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>237 mL warm water (43-46°C)</li>
            <li>11 g active dry yeast</li>
            <li>454 g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>30 mL olive oil</li>
            <li>5 mL salt</li>
            <li>2 mL sugar</li>
            <li>250 g mozzarella cheese, sliced or shredded</li>
            <li>fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>8-10 cherry tomatoes, sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the water and yeast. Let sit for a few minutes until the yeast is activated and foamy.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, olive oil, salt, and sugar to the bowl. Mix until the dough comes together in a ball.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Set aside in a warm place to rise for about 1 hour, until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C (425°F).</li>
            <li>On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a large circle or rectangle, depending on your preference. Transfer the dough to a baking sheet or pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Spread the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Top with the mozzarella cheese and sliced cherry tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
