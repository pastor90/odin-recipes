        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Potato gnocchi are small, soft dumplings made from mashed potatoes, flour, and egg. They are often served with sauces such as pesto, marinara, or melted butter and cheese.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Prick the potatoes all over with a fork, then place them on a baking sheet and bake for 45-60 minutes, or until tender.</li>
            <li>When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and pass them through a potato ricer or mash them with a fork. Transfer the mashed potatoes to a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, egg, and a pinch of salt to the bowl with the potatoes. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Dust a clean surface with flour and turn the dough out onto it. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll each piece into a long, thin rope about 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut the ropes into 1/2 inch pieces to form the gnocchi.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop the gnocchi into the water, a few at a time, and cook until they float to the surface, about 2-3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked gnocchi to a colander to drain.</li>
            <li>Serve the gnocchi hot, with your choice of sauce.</li>
        </ol>
