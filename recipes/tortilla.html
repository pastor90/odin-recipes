        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A Spanish tortilla, also known as a potato omelette, is a traditional dish from Spain made with potatoes, onions, and eggs. It is typically cooked in a large, shallow pan and is often served as a tapa, or small snack, in bars and restaurants. Spanish tortillas are usually sliced into wedges and can be served hot or at room temperature. They are a popular choice for a quick and easy meal and are often served with a salad or other vegetables. They can be made with a variety of ingredients, such as bell peppers, chorizo, and other vegetables, but the basic recipe consists of potatoes, onions, and eggs.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 potatoes, peeled and sliced into thin rounds</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the potatoes and onion, and cook until the potatoes are tender and the onion is translucent.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl and season with salt. Add the eggs to the pan with the potatoes and onion, and stir gently to combine.</li>
            <li>Cook the tortilla until the edges start to set, then use a spatula to carefully lift the edges and allow the uncooked egg to flow underneath.</li>
            <li>When the tortilla is mostly set, carefully slide it onto a plate, then place the pan upside down over the plate and flip the pan and plate together to invert the tortilla back into the pan.</li>
            <li>Cook the other side of the tortilla until it is golden brown and fully set.</li>
            <li>Serve the tortilla warm, cut into wedges.</li>
        </ol>
